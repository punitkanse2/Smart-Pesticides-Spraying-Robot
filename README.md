# Smart-Pesticides-Spraying-Robot
The robot is installed in the farm and is operated by an Android application and is powered by IoT. DC motors are used for
the robot's motion that are governed electronically by Arduino UNO with the assistance of L293D. The HC-05 Bluetooth
module receives signals from the input and sends them to the controller, which in turn spins the engine. By obtaining the
signal, DC motors are switched ON and OFF by allowing Arduino to have a specific pin. An adequate velocity is provided
by 300rpm DC motors. Bluetooth module connects to the digital key of Arduino UNO, which receives the signal installed on
the operator's Smartphone from the Android app. Pesticide spraying, which can be done with the assistance of a pesticide
sprinkling pump, can be done on a regular basis if the relay switch is turned on. The agricultural robot is used to control
functions such as pesticide spraying, and it is controlled using a Bluetooth module that communicates between an Android
application and the robot for a low cost.
