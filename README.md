# Smart-Pesticides-Spraying-Robot
The aim of this paper is to create an intelligent spraying robot that will decrease pesticide use and human health
damage, allowing farmers to be protected and labour intensity can be reduced. The robot will have full route planning and
navigation systems, as well as driving control, spraying mechanism and system construction and obstacle avoidance with
multi-sensor module integration. The spray robot will be designed, including obstacle avoidance, spraying, and sensor
integration simulations and analyses. It is used not only to track motion and monitor orientation, but also to compensate for
path errors in order to achieve good stability and reliability. Meanwhile, the spraying system will be improved to eliminate
leaks and prevent repeated spraying, with automatic sprays varying according to the target. This project proposes a pesticide
spraying system which will help farmers in field of agriculture
